# For Publish

- Contents sidebar needs re configuring.
	- Wrap the labels.
- Cite sources; evaluate the references I need.
- Content for other typologies.
- Maybe be more inclusive so it isn't just a wiki; also a random blog post
- Cool diagrams.
- Categorise my stuff better (i.e. relation subgroups --> -chotomies --> space --> page)

## Permutations of $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{S})$

1: (k i) (a c) (l h) (q m) = mixes elements across proc/res

2: (k q l a) (i m h c) = mixes elements across proc/res cyclically

3: (x d) (S s) (i h) (m c) = mixes elements across i/e

4: (b S) (B s) (a c) (q m) = mixes elements across p/j

5: (k l) (a q) (c m) (h i) = mixes elements across proc/res
