# Partition Spaces

- Monochotomy = the hexadecadic set which comprises of the full Socion.
- Dichotomy = the division of the Socion into 2 distinct sets (traits or octads).
- Tetrachotomy = the division of the Socion into 4 distinct sets, or tetrads (formed by the intersection of three nontrivial dichotomies).
- Octachotomy = the division of the Socion into 8 distinct sets, or dyads (formed by the intersection of 7 nontrivial dichotomies).
- Hexadecachotomy = the division of the Socion into its 16 monadic elements, or types of information metabolism (TIMs), and is formed by the intersection of all elements from a dichotomy system.

## Dichotomy Spaces and Traits

- $\mathfrak{d}$ = a dichotomy from a valid system of dichotomies where $\mathfrak{d}_0$ and $\mathfrak{d}_1$ are complementary traits. Alternatively, for any dichotomy, $D$ is used.
- $\mathfrak{D}$ = a system of dichotomies.
- $\mathcal{D}$ = the family of all orbital-respecting dichotomies (16 in total), with the subscript $i$ denoting the system. The list of all "orbital-respecting dichotomy systems" proceeds as follows...
	- $\mathcal{D}_1$ = Receptive-Adaptive Result Compass Process HEF  
	- $\mathcal{D}_{2}$ = Semidual Mirage HEF 
	- $\mathcal{D}_{3}$ = Kindred Business HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{4}$ = Flexible-Manoeuvring Result Compass Process HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{5}$ = Parallel Club Quadra Charged Rationality
	- $\mathcal{D}_{6}$ = Parallel Club Quadra Charged Rationality
	- $\mathcal{D}_{7}$ = Balanced-Stable Process Compass Result HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{8}$ = Perpendicular Club Quadra Vertedness
	- $\mathcal{D}_{9}$ = Activation Quasi-Identity HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{10}$ = Balanced-Stable Result Compass Process HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{11}$ = Linear-Assertive Result Compass Process HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{12}$ = Mirror Conflict HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{13}$ =
