# Partition Spaces

- Monochotomy = the hexadecadic set which comprises of the full Socion.
- Dichotomy = the division of the Socion into 2 distinct sets (traits or octads).
- Tetrachotomy = the division of the Socion into 4 distinct sets, or tetrads (formed by the intersection of three nontrivial dichotomies).
- Octachotomy = the division of the Socion into 8 distinct sets, or dyads (formed by the intersection of 7 nontrivial dichotomies).
- Hexadecachotomy = the division of the Socion into its 16 monadic elements, or types of information metabolism (TIMs), and is formed by the intersection of all elements from a dichotomy system.

## Dichotomy Spaces and Traits

- $\mathfrak{d}$ = a dichotomy from a valid system of dichotomies where $\mathfrak{d}_0$ and $\mathfrak{d}_1$ are complementary traits. Alternatively, for any dichotomy, $D$ is used.
- $\mathfrak{D}$ = a system of dichotomies0
- $\mathcal{D}$ = the family of all orbital-respecting dichotomies (16 in total), with the subscript $i$ denoting the system. The list of all orbital-respecting dichotomy systems"
