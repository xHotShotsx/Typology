# Partition Spaces

- Monochotomy = the hexadecadic set which comprises of the full Socion.
- Dichotomy = the division of the Socion into 2 distinct sets (traits or octads).
- Tetrachotomy = the division of the Socion into 4 distinct sets, or tetrads (formed by the intersection of three nontrivial dichotomies).
- Octachotomy = the division of the Socion into 8 distinct sets, or dyads (formed by the intersection of 7 nontrivial dichotomies).
- Hexadecachotomy = the division of the Socion into its 16 monadic elements, or types of information metabolism (TIMs), and is formed by the intersection of all elements from a dichotomy system.

## Dichotomy Spaces and Traits

- $\mathfrak{d}$ = a dichotomy from a valid system of dichotomies where $\mathfrak{d}_0$ and $\mathfrak{d}_1$ are complementary traits. Alternatively, for any dichotomy, $D$ is used.
- $\mathfrak{D}$ = a system of dichotomies.
- $\mathcal{D}$ = the family of all orbital-respecting dichotomies (16 in total), with the subscript $i$ denoting the system. The list of all "orbital-respecting dichotomy systems" proceeds as follows...
	- $\mathcal{D}_1$ = Receptive-Adaptive Result Compass Process HEF  
	- $\mathcal{D}_{2}$ = Semidual Mirage HEF 
	- $\mathcal{D}_{3}$ = Kindred Business HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{4}$ = Flexible-Manoeuvring Result Compass Process HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{5}$ = Parallel Club Quadra Charged Rationality
	- $\mathcal{D}_{6}$ = Parallel Club Quadra Charged Rationality
	- $\mathcal{D}_{7}$ = Balanced-Stable Process Compass Result HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{8}$ = Perpendicular Club Quadra Vertedness
	- $\mathcal{D}_{9}$ = Activation Quasi-Identity HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{10}$ = Balanced-Stable Result Compass Process HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{11}$ = Linear-Assertive Result Compass Process HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{12}$ = Mirror Conflict HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{13}$ = Receptive-Adaptive Process Compass Result HEF
	- $\mathcal{D}_{14}$ = Tencer-Minaev
	- $\mathcal{D}_{15}$ = Reinin
	- $\mathcal{D}_{16}$ = Flexible-Manoeuvring Process Compass Result HEF
- $\mathbf{V}$ is the vector space associated with an $i$ dichotomy system that acts on the sociotypes, denoted $\mathbf{V}_{i}$. Refer to my [[Partition Spaces/Dichotomies/TIM Dichotomy Index]] for the basis vectors for each dichotomy system (these correspond to the 1st order dichotomies used for boolean algebras for a system of dichotomies). The vectors themselves are encoded via XOR logic, so for example the zero vector corresponds to the identity element. Sometimes XNOR logic is used to express the elements, where the identity element is represented by the one vector, but the former is mostly used.

## Intertype Relations

- $\mathbb{S}$: This is the group of all intertype relations in Socionics. This group is isomorphic to $D_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ (the direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 2). The elements of $\mathbb{S}$ proceeds as follows:
	- $e$ = identity, or identical  
	- $d$ = dual  
	- $a$ = activator  
	- $m$ = mirror  
	- $g$ = superego  
	- $c$ = conflict  
	- $q$ = quasi-identical  
	- $x$ = extinguishment, or contrary  
	- $S$ = supervisor  
	- $B$ = benefactor  
	- $k$ = kindred  
	- $h$ = semidual, or half-dual  
	- $s$ = supervisee  
	- $b$ = beneficiary  
	- $l$ = business, or lookalike  
	- $i$  mirage, or illusory
