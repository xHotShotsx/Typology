## Formalisation of the $E_{16}$ model

- Explain principle behind group (elementary abelian group of order 16, isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^4_{2}$).
- Explain how it could be represented as a 4D vector space over $\mathbb{F}_2$.
- Explain how it is based on dichotomy spaces (so there are 16 possible renditions, and these include both models L and W).
- ITRs are $E_{16}$ and derived from the respective dichotomy system of assessed model, we'll denote $\mathcal{R}_i$ the "modern" group of intertype relations (this is subject to change).
- Within any given model, there is a set of $\mathfrak{F}$ (notation subject to change) and a set of relations $\mathcal{R}_i$ such that there is a bijection between them: $$f_{\mathcal{D}_{i}} : \mathfrak{F} \longrightarrow \mathcal{R}_i$$
- Demonstrate how $\mathcal{R}_i$ could be derived from $\mathfrak{D}$.
- OR;
- $\mathfrak{F}$ is a permutation group of $\mathcal{R}_i$ once the dichotomy space is specified, since $\mathcal{R}_{i}$ not only acts on types, but also on functions. Since by applying any relationship $r$ switches the functions that correspond to the subgroup that pairs $r$ with the identity $e$ that correspond to a particular octachotomy $er$, the functions that correspond to the cosets of that subgroup also switch places.
- there is an equivariant bijection between the objects that $\mathcal{R}_i$ acts on (the set of types $T$ and the functional layout for a type $t \in T$ of a set model a given $\mathcal{R}_i$ acts on, denoted $\mathcal{F}_t$).
- develop a hierarchy for function models
- express this bijective mapping as a functor.
