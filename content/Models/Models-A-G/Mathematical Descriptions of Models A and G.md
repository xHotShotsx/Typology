# The Transitive Permutation Group 8T9

The transitive permutation group 8T9 is the 9th transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{8}$ (acting on 8 points) in the database of transitive groups. It is known to be isomorphic to the direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 2 ($D_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$).

## Model A

In Model A, we have a set $F_{MA}$ of 8 functions (labelled points) and a set 

$$I = \{ \mathrm{Ne}, \mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Ti}, \mathrm{Se}, \mathrm{Ni}, \mathrm{Te}, \mathrm{Fi} \}$$

of 8 information metabolism elements (IMEs) occupying $F_{MA}$. The group which comprises of classical intertype relations $\mathbb{S} \cong D_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ acts on functions transitively by permuting them in specific ways depending on the action applied (i.e. the relationship that acts on Model A by permuting its set of functions). For instance, the kindred relationship $k \in \mathbb{S}$ exchanges functions 2 and 4, but also functions 6 and 8. Therefore, we can denote this as $(2,4)(6,8)$. An order 4 relationship like the supervisee $s \in \mathbb{S}$ shifts functions 1-4 as well as functions 5-8, cyclically, which can be expressed as $(1,2,3,4)(5,6,7,8)$. 

$\mathbb{S}$ can be described as the group generated by certain permutations such as $s = (1,2,3,4)(5,6,7,8)$, $d = (1,5)(2,6)(3,7)(4,8)$, and $a = (1,6)(2,5)(3,8)(4,7)$. That is, $s(1)=2$, $s(2)=3$, etc. From these generators, it follows directly that this permutation group is isomorphic to $D_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$, that acts on 8 points, and thus easily verifiable that Model A is an example of the transitive permutation group 8T9.

# The Transitive Permutation Group 8T2

The transitive permutation group 8T2 is the 2nd transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_8$ (acting on 8 points) in the database of transitive groups. It is known to be isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 2 and 4 ($\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$, respectively).

## Model G

In Model G, we have a set $F_{MG}$ of 8 functions (labelled points) and a set

$$\mathcal{E} = \{ \mathrm{?Ne^+}, \mathrm{!Si^-},  \mathrm{!Fe^+}, \mathrm{?Ti^-}, \mathrm{?Fe^-}, \mathrm{!Ti^+}, \mathrm{!Se^-}, \mathrm{?Ni^+}, \mathrm{?Se^+}, \mathrm{!Ni^-}, \mathrm{!Te^+}, \mathrm{?Fi^-}, \mathrm{?Te^-}, \mathrm{!Fi^+}, \mathrm{!Ne^-}, \mathrm{?Si^+} \}$$

of 16 monadic (signed) elements, half of which occupy $F_{MG}$, depending on whether a type is Process or Result. The set of functions are acted upon by the index-2 subgroup of $\mathbb{S}$ that describes Process/Result, for which we'll denote $H$, and is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$. $H$ acts on functions in specific ways depending on the action applied.

Like with $\mathbb{S}$, $H$ can be described by certain permutations such as $B = (1,2,3,4)(5,6,7,8)$ for order 4 relationships and $d = (1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,5)$ for order 2 relationships. From these generators, it follows directly that this permutation group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$, that acts on 8 points, and thus easily verifiable that Model G is an example of the transitive permutation group 8T2. 

Since Model-G does not model all elements of the full socion for a type $t \in T$, the construction of Model G layouts for both process and result types, for which we'll denote $P$ and $R$, respectively, are needed to represent all information in the Socion. Thus, Model-G can be formally understood as $F_{MG} \times \{ P, R \}$ with $H$ acting on $F_{MG}$, the selector dichotomy (Process/Result) acting on $\{ P, R \}$ and no group action mixing the two.

# Alternate Interpretations of Model A (Systems of Injections)

The set $I$ is sometimes substituted for the set $\mathcal{E}$, and consequently the acting group on Model A is no longer $\mathbb{S}$, but an index-2 subgroup of it. For example, in the School of Classical Socionics (SCS), the set of functions is acted on by $H \cong \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$ (Process/Result), so in this sense Models A and G are isomorphic (both 8T2 groups). However, in the School of System Socionics (SSS), the set of functions are acted on by the Asking/Declaring subgroup, which is isomorphic to $D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8). In this sense, Model A can be described as the transitive permutation group 8T4, which is a subgroup of $S_8$ and is isomorphic to $D_4$.

Finally, the 'Presence Cube' model demonstrates the constructed vector space on Model A. $F_{MA}$ has size $2^3$ so we can construct a dichotomy system on it. There are only two order 8 subgroups of $\mathbb{S}$, which are isomorphic to the vector space $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^3$, namely Democratic/Aristocratic and Irrational/Rational, denoted $D$ and $J$. Of the two, only $D$ acts transitively on $F_{MA}$ (e.g. Ne can occur in any position in a Democratic type), and the actions of $D$ on $F_{MA}$ are faithful to $\mathbb{S}$. In this sense, this construction of Model A can be described as the transitive permutation group 8T3, which is a subgroup of $S_8$ and is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^3_{2}$.

## What counts as an acceptable system of injections?

An acceptable system of injections on Model A must arise from an index-2 subgroup of $\mathbb{S}$ corresponding to a _supralocal_ dichotomy. These include Democratic/Aristocratic, Asking/Declaring, Process/Result, and Positivist/Negativist.

The reason for this restriction is structural. Each information element $i \in I$ admits a decomposition into its associated monadic elements in $\mathcal{E}$, and any admissible injection must preserve this correspondence. Equivalently, for every function in $F_{MA}$, either the unsplit element $i$ or exactly one of its associated monadic refinements must be present, uniformly across all types.

Index-2 subgroups not associated with supralocal dichotomies (these are the 'general' dichotomies, which when intersected define the temperament tetrachotomy) fail to satisfy this condition, as they induce splittings that cannot be reconciled with the monadic decomposition of elements in $I$. Consequently, no other index-2 subgroup of $\mathbb{S}$ yields a coherent or admissible system of injections on Model A.
