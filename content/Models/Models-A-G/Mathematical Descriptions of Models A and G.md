# The Transitive Permutation Group 8T9

The transitive permutation group 8T9 is the 9th transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{8}$ (acting on 8 points) in the database of transitive groups. It is known to be isomorphic to the direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 2 ($D_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$).

## Model A

In Model A, we have a set $F_{MA}$ of 8 functions (labelled points) and a set 

$$I = \{ \mathrm{Ne}, \mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Ti}, \mathrm{Se}, \mathrm{Ni}, \mathrm{Te}, \mathrm{Fi} \}$$

of 8 information metabolism elements (IMEs) occupying $F_{MA}$. The group which comprises of classical intertype relations $\mathbb{S} \cong D_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ acts on functions transitively by permuting them in specific ways depending on the action applied (i.e. the relationship that acts on Model A by permuting its set of functions). For instance, the kindred relationship $k \in \mathbb{S}$ exchanges functions 2 and 4, but also functions 6 and 8. Therefore, we can denote this as $(2,4)(6,8)$. An order 4 relationship like the supervisee $s \in \mathbb{S}$ shifts functions 1-4 as well as functions 5-8, cyclically, which can be expressed as $(1,2,3,4)(5,6,7,8)$. 

$\mathbb{S}$ can be described as the group generated by certain permutations such as $s = (1,2,3,4)(5,6,7,8)$, $d = (1,5)(2,6)(3,7)(4,8)$, and $a = (1,6)(2,5)(3,8)(4,7)$. That is, $s(1)=2$, $s(2)=3$, etc. From these generators, it follows directly that this permutation group is isomorphic to $D_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$, that acts on 8 points, and thus easily verifiable that Model A is an example of the transitive permutation group 8T9.

# The Transitive Permutation Group 8T2

The transitive permutation group 8T2 is the 2nd transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_8$ (acting on 8 points) in the database of transitive groups. It is known to be isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 2 and 4 ($\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$, respectively).

## Model G

In Model G, we have a set $F_{MG}$ of 8 functions (labelled points) and a set

$$\mathcal{E} = \{ \mathrm{?Ne^+}, \mathrm{!Si^-},  \mathrm{!Fe^+}, \mathrm{?Ti^-}, \mathrm{?Fe^-}, \mathrm{!Ti^+}, \mathrm{!Se^-}, \mathrm{?Ni^+}, \mathrm{?Se^+}, \mathrm{!Ni^-}, \mathrm{!Te^+}, \mathrm{?Fi^-}, \mathrm{?Te^-}, \mathrm{!Fi^+}, \mathrm{!Ne^-}, \mathrm{?Si^+} \}$$

of 16 monadic (signed) elements, half of which occupy $F_{MG}$, depending on whether a type is Process or Result. The set of functions are acted upon by the index-2 subgroup of $\mathbb{S}$ that describes Process/Result, for which we'll denote $H$, and is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$. $H$ acts on functions in specific ways depending on the action applied.

Like with $\mathbb{S}$, $H$ can be described by certain permutations such as $B = (1,2,3,4)(5,6,7,8)$ for order 4 relationships and $d = (1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,5)$ for order 2 relationships. From these generators, it follows directly that this permutation group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$, that acts on 8 points, and thus easily verifiable that Model G is an example of the transitive permutation group 8T2. 

Since Model-G does not model all elements of the full socion for a type $t \in T$, the construction of Model G layouts for both process and result types, for which we'll denote $P$ and $R$, respectively, are needed to represent all information in the Socion. Thus, Model-G can be formally understood as $F_{MG} \times \{ P, R \}$ with $H$ acting on $F_{MG}$, the selector dichotomy (Process/Result) acting on $\{ P, R \}$ and no group action mixing the two.

# Alternate Interpretations of Model A - Systems of Injections

The set $I$ is sometimes substituted for the set $\mathcal{E}$, and consequently the acting group on Model A is no longer $\mathbb{S}$, but an index-2 subgroup of it. For example, in the School of Classical Socionics (SCS), the set of functions is acted on by $H \cong \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$ (Process/Result), so in this sense Models A and G are isomorphic (both 8T2 groups). However, in the School of System Socionics (SSS), the set of functions are acted on by the Asking/Declaring subgroup, which is isomorphic to $D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8). In this sense, Model A can be described as the transitive permutation group 8T4, which is a subgroup of $S_8$ and is isomorphic to $D_4$.

Finally, the 'Presence Cube' model demonstrates the constructed vector space on Model A. $F_{MA}$ has size $2^3$ so we can construct a dichotomy system on it. There are only two order 8 subgroups of $\mathbb{S}$, which are isomorphic to the vector space $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^3$
