# The Transitive Permutation Group 8T9

- The transitive permutation group 8T9 is the 9th transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{8}$ (acting on 8 points) in the database of transitive groups. It is known to be the direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 2 ($D_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$).

## Model A

In Model A, we have a set $F_{MA}$ of 8 functions (labelled points) and a set 

$$I = \{ \mathrm{Ne}, \mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Ti}, \mathrm{Se}, \mathrm{Ni}, \mathrm{Te}, \mathrm{Fi} \}$$

of information metabolism elements (IMEs). The group which comprises of classical intertype relations $\mathbb{S} \cong D_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ acts on functions transitively by permuting them in specific ways depending on the action applied (i.e. the relationship that acts on Model A by permuting its set of functions). For instance, the kindred relationship $k \in \mathbb{S}$ exchanges functions 2 and 4, but also 6 and 8. Therefore, we can denote this as $(2,4)(6,8)$. The supervisee relationship $s \in \mathbb{S}$ shifts 1-4 as well as functions 5-8, cyclically, which can be expressed as $(1,2,3,4)(5,6,7,8)$. 

$\mathbb{S}$ can be described as the group generated by certain permutations such as $s = (1,2,3,4)(5,6,7,8)$, $d = (1,5)(2,6)(3,7)(4,8)
