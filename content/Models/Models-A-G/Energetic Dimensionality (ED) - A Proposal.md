# The Gulenko-Newman Dichotomies that Correspond to ED

1. Energetic/Informational $e B s d$  
2. Excitable/Inhibitable $e s b x$  
3. Opening/Closing $e g s S$  


# Formula for ED

 All functions have a baseline of 1d because of the tautological valid/null condition.
- If energetic  
	- Then ED = valid + 2d  
- If opening  
	- Then ED = valid + 1d
  
# ED to Informational Dimensionality (ID) Comparisons using Function Dichotomies from both Models A and G

- Energetic/Informational is to ED as Strong/Weak is to ID.
- Opening/Closing is to ED as Bold/Cautious is to ID.
- Excitable/Inhibitable is to ED as Evaluatory/Situational is to ID.

# Expanding this schema to 16 elements

If introversion/extroversion is responsible for informatic dimensionality, we’ll assume positivist/negativist as the contributor to energetic dimensionality. We will be using Varlawend’s System 2 (Reference 5) here. Now, energetic functions map onto the two binary relations that entail Process/Result as the third dichotomy in relation to a tetrachotomy formation. The exact dichotomies used will be dependent on the displacement tetrad the given TIM falls under, due to the asymmetric ITR injection used for functions in this space, where asymmetries split in relation to dichotomies; Asking/Declaring, Positivist/Negativist, and Static/Dynamic. Defer to ‘Intertype Relations’ (Reference 1) for more information about this as well as ‘Function Dichotomies to Type Tetrachotomies’ (Reference 2) for which dichotomies of this space (Reference 3) slot into Energetic/Informational and Excitable/Inhibitable based on the displacement tetrad any TIM falls under, in discussion.

So, pretexts aside, the formula for energetic dimensionality goes as follows:


Valid = baseline of 1d  
TIM+Mirage HEF = +1d  
TIM+Semidual HEF = +1d  
Shared Positivism/Negativism = +1d  

So, to give an example for the ILI, let’s take !Se-:

Valid = baseline of 1d  
NOT ILI+IEE = +0d  
SLE+ILI = +1d  
Negativist = +1d  

Therefore, !Se- has an energetic content of 3d for the ILI.

# IMPORTANT NOTE

This post regarding energetic dimensionality is tentative, so take it with a grain of salt. There may be other factors I haven’t considered for the purpose of simplification. For instance, one issue to note is that besides process/result, the function monochotomy for Model-G, both static/dynamic and positivist/negativist contributes to the Opening and Closing rings, so an alternative framing of the formula, depending on semantic relevance, could involve replacing Positivist/Negativist with Static/Dynamic as responsible for the formulation of energetic content of sociotype.
