## Sets

- $\mathfrak{d}$ = a dichotomy.
- $\mathfrak{t}(\mathfrak{d})$ = the set of binary traits that are generated by a dichotomy.
- $\mathfrak{D}$ = the set of the 8 wall dichotomies that, when combined with the 7 orbital dichotomies, form a dichotomy system. NB $\mathfrak{D}$ is also used to represent the dichotomy system itself.
- $\mathfrak{T}(\mathfrak{D})$ = the set of all traits that are generated by a set of dichotomies $\mathfrak{D}$.
- $\mathcal{D}$ =
