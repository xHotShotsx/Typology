## Sets

- $\mathfrak{d}$ = a dichotomy.
- $\mathfrak{t}(\mathfrak{d})$ = set of binary traits that are generated by a dichotomy.
- $\mathfrak{D}$ = set of the 8 wall dichotomies that, when combined with the 7 orbital dichotomies, form a dichotomy system. NB $\mathfrak{D}$ is also used to represent the dichotomy system itself.
- $\mathfrak{T}(\mathfrak{D})$ = set of all traits that are generated by a set of dichotomies $\mathfrak{D}$.
- $\mathcal{D}$ = set of all identified dichotomy systems. NB This may be sometimes referred to as the "Varlawend" spaces.

### Indexing
#### $\mathfrak{d}$
- A dichotomy $\mathfrak{d}$ is $\{\mathfrak{d}_{0}, \mathfrak{d}_{1}\}$ where $\mathfrak{d}_0$ and $\mathfrak{d}_1$ are compliments inside a boolean lattice.
- If a dichotomy is a set of boolean compliments and a set of dichotomies in the lattice forms a vector space over $\mathbb{F}_2$, 
- Therefore,
