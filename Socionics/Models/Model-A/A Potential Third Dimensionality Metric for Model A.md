So, the user magi_cicada noted something interesting about the functional structure of Model-A, noting the orthogonality of function dichotomies with respect to each other besides bold/cautious, which would typically be the ‘amplifier’ for presence metrics, such as dimensionality and priority. So, these would be the dichotomies that operate orthogonally with one another:

  

*Strong/Weak **with** Evaluatory/Situational*
Valued/Subdued with Inert/Contact
Mental/Vital with Accepting/Producing

  

As you may have noticed, the first two sets of dichotomies pertain to dimensionality and priority, respectively. But there’s a third. Now, we can approach this in two ways. This could be pertaining to rationality or how “accepting” a function is, or how “mental” a function is. The latter seems to make more sense here considering the semantic context of the other two metrics, so it is inference based, as well as the fact that dichotomies Strong/Weak, Valued/Subdued, and Mental/Vital split the model horizontally, whereas Inert/Contact, Evaluatory/Situational and Accepting/Producing split the layout vertically. So, in this framing, with bold/cautious being the consistent amplifier, and by letting ‘c’ be the notation for the level of "consciousness” of a given function (note that 'mental/vital' is sometimes called 'conscious/unconscious'), we can use these three Model-A dichotomies to determine the degree of “consciousness” of functions, noting that all functions have a baseline of 1c, with:

Mental: +2c
Bold: +1c
Accepting: 4c or 1c
