# Preface

- The set of information elements can be defined via dichotomy systems under which the kindred intertype relation is invariant when mapped to a vector space induced by the system. Although all 
- Alternatively, if you isolate the information metabolism elements (IMEs) as a unique set then there will still be 7 dichotomies, per system of dichotomies, in order to differentiate them distinctly.
