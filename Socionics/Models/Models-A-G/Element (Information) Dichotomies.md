# Preface

- The set of information elements can be defined by the intersection of a heptad of dichotomies from a system of dichotomies where the kindred relationship is invariant when mapped to a vector in the vector space constructed by a dichotomy system. For more information on which Intertype Relations are invariant relative to a dichotomy system, check out Section 7 of [[A Representation-Theoretic Framework for Intertype Relations in Socionics]].
- Alternatively, if you isolate the information metabolism elements (IMEs)
