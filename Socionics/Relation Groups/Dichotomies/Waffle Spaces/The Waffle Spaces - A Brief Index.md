The numeric codes assigned to dichotomies other than maybe the X space are arbitrary, and even the letter assignments are based on order of discovery.

# The “waffle” spaces (X-Δ) identified by the small group shared with the ILE:

X Space — Irrational-Democratic-Process

Z Space — Static-Process-Positivist
A Space — Irrational-Asking-Positivist
B Space — Extroverted-Irrational-Static
Γ Space — Static-Democratic-Asking
Δ Space — Extroverted-Democratic-Positivist
