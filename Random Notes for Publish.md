- Contents sidebar needs reconfiguring.
	- Wrap the labels.
- Cite sources; evaluate the references I need.
- Content for other typologies.
- Maybe be more inclusive so it isn't just a wiki; also a random blogpost
- Cool diagrams.
- Categorise my stuff better (i.e. relation subgroups --> -chotomies --> space --> page)
